# Context-Aware-Home-Automation using LLMs as Middleware
This repository implements an intelligent middleware that allows you to control every device in your home using natural language. Forget simple triggers - chat with true contextual understanding.

"Hey home, movie night please!" üçø dims the lights, pulls the blinds, turns the TV on and sets the mood just right, exactly how you want it. Our advanced neural models actually understand what you mean. They translate complex requests like these into dynamic smart home function calls to create personalized, context-aware automation experiences.

This is made possible by fine-tuned BERT architectures designed specifically for the intricacies of smart environment voice commands. They learn the unique language patterns involved in human-home interactions.

If you think smart assistants should go beyond simple voice triggers and basic commands, and enable truly intelligent environments, this is the project for you! üè†‚ö°Ô∏è"
