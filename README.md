# Context-Aware-Home-Automation using LLMs as Middleware
This repository implements an intelligent middleware that allows you to control every device in your home using natural language. Forget simple triggers - chat with true contextual understanding.

"Hey home, movie night please!" üçø dims the lights, pulls the blinds, turns the TV on and sets the mood just right, exactly how you want it. Our advanced neural models actually understand what you mean. They translate complex requests like these into dynamic smart home function calls to create personalized, context-aware automation experiences.

Middleware in the concept of smart homes is typically the NLP algorithms that are present between the Speech-to-text engines on the input side and the Program that controls the Output devices. In the current landscape of smart home automation, voice-activated assistants have become common. They provide users with a degree of control over their connected devices. However, existing systems often face limitations in understanding complex user commands, leading to a fragmented and less intuitive user experience. These systems typically rely on predefined trigger words or phrases, limiting their ability to comprehend context-rich instructions and adapt to evolving user preferences. This Project leverages the power of LLMs to work as middleware in smart homes. The system aims to understand and execute intricate user commands, offering a more natural and user-friendly interaction model. Consider the scenario where a user commands, "Prepare the living room for movie night." In response, the Language Model Middleware (LLMM) would intelligently call pre-defined functions such as set_light(location, R, G, B) and power_on(device, setting). This approach aims to elevate the smart home experience by allowing users to communicate seamlessly with their connected devices, making interactions more personalized and context-aware.

By integrating LLMs into the middleware, the system aspires to go beyond conventional voice assistants, adapting to diverse and evolving user preferences. The focus is not only on understanding complex commands but also on enhancing the overall user experience through intelligent and context-aware device control.

If you think smart assistants should go beyond simple voice triggers and basic commands, and enable truly intelligent environments, this is the project for you! üè†‚ö°Ô∏è"
